========

Implemented an editable wiki site and deployed it on Google App Engine (http://wei-wiki.appspot.com/).


How it works?
=============

Create a new wiki page:
Easy and user-friendly! Just modify the URL in your browser and you'll create a wiki page for your own (You might need to login or sign up at first).

Edit your wiki page:
Try to click the 'edit' button at the top-right corner.

Look at the history of your wiki page:
Try to click the 'history' button at the top-right corner.
